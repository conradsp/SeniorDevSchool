# Senior Dev School

See [Senior Dev School](https://seniordevschool.com) for more information

Exercises to help developers level up their skills.

In a world where more and more developers are learning basic skills through bootcamps or by taking online courses, there is a growing need for senior developers. Learning a language or framework is a good entrypoint to the world of software development, but we want to create a path for junior developers to get better. 

Becoming a senior developer is not just a matter of learning more languages and frameworks. A senior developer has experience with large and complex systems and has developed instincts about how to design and debug these systems. There is no better experience than working directly on complex projects. But for new or junior developers, they may not have an opportunity to work on these types of systems. This repository is a way for devs to work on some platforms that they may not otherwise be able to learn. 

This repository contains a series of lessons that will help developers work on complex systems, debugging and solving problems. Each lesson will provide opportunities to learn about different aspects of development, like containerization, security, and performance. More importantly, each lesson will help the user to learn how to solve hard software engineering problems.

A senior developer also has developed soft skills and knows how to be the kind of developer that other people want to work with. Unfortunately, we can't teach you that. We do hope these lessons help you hone your technical skills - and we encourage you to be a developer who is kind, generous, and helpful.

# How it works

Each Lesson is in a separate folder. The readme for the lesson contains a Research section, a Code section, and a Problems section.

The Research section gives an overview of the topics that will be taught. 

It will also point you to other resources to learn. It's a core skill for a senior developer to be able to find resources online and learn from them. (And that doesn't mean just looking for code snippits on StackOverflow!)

The Code section will tell you what prerequisites need to be installed in your development environment. From there, you will be invited  

The Problems section will outline issues for you to fix or tasks to accomplish on the codebase
