Rails app that displays a list of users from a database.

  * First, look at the Dockerfile for this application and make sure that you understand what the Dockerfile is doing to build the rails image  
  * Start the application and navigate to http://localhost:4000. The app should show a list of users from the database, but there is an error in the Docker configuration
  * Update the docker files to get the application to run correctly. There are two issues that need to be resolved in order to get the application to run.
